# BudgetR 

## Project

*BudgetR is a mobile application which allows individuals of any age to monitor their expenses, allowing them to further grow their capital. The following project aims to eliminate the need for users to write down their spendings on paper. This application offers users the opportunity to keep track of their expenses by recording their spending(s) on their mobile phones. After recording an expense, the application will demonstrate how much the individual has spent as well as where they have spent their money, e.g. "Â£50 -- British Airways".*
